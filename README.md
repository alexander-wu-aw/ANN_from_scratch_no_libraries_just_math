# ANN_from_scratch_no_libraries_just_math
Nowadays, creating an AI algorithm is incredibly easy. Using a few libraries will allow any model to be created with only a few lines of code.

But I realized that this made me incredibly disconnected with the underlying principles of AI. The math: the calculas, linear algebra, and probability that is the backbone of neural networks. So to get back in touch with the fundamentals, I built a vanilla neural network using nothing but python. No libraries, just math.
